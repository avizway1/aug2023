=====================================================================================

EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : Server class :  Region specific service

CPU, Memory/RAM, Storage/HDD/SDD, Network (wifi, bt, NIC/ENI)

Instance = Server = Azure VM = Compute engine = box

CLient Class OS : Win7, win10
Server Class OS : Windows server 2008 r2, 2012, 2012 r2, 2016, 2019

On-Demand ec2 instances : When we have unpredictable workloads.. Testing our application for the firsttime.. "FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY"
Pricing : /Sec (With min of 60 Sec)

Reserved ec2 instances : When out workload is stable and predictable.. For longer durations.. We can reserve the capacity for 1yr/3yr.. "NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY""

	Standard RI : We cannot change config during the period. 
	Convertable RI : We can change/exchange the config during the period.

Pricing : 
Full Upfront : Pay 100% as onetime. 
Partial upfront : Pay 30-50% as onetime, Then remaining amount pay monthly basis with redused hourly price, based on usage.
No upfront : Pay everything monthly basis. 
--> AWS Marketplace : We can sell our resources. 

Spot instances : When we have flexible start/stop durations.. No Criticaldata/ application is delivering..!!  Test env.. 
Bid your price against AWS pricing. If our quoted price is euqual or greater than aws pricing, we will get the instance.
--> high confi server at low cost for temp requ.
"NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY"
--> quoted price is euqual or greater than aws pricing, we will get the instance.
--> If price increased, AWS will terminate(delete) our instance.

1 hr 50 Min : Price increased, AWS Terminated our Instance : 1 Hr
1 hr 50 Min : Price not increased, You Terminated our Instance : 1 Hr 50 Min

______________________________________

Instance = Azure VM = GCP Engine = Virtual Machine = Box = Server 


Step 1 : Add Tags

Step 2 : Choose AMI (Windows, Amazon Linux, redhat, suse, ubuntu....)

Step 3 : Instance type (t2.micro) (CPU and Memory)

Step 4 : Create a Keypair (Default Username and password to login)

Step 5 : Network configuration (AZ/PublicIP/What ports you want to open)

Step 6 : Choose Storage options (SSD/HDD/Magnetic)


______________________________________


Only On-Demand ec2 instances comes under free tier eligibility.
** Fix to one region. ap-south-1

Windows ec2 instance launch : 

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)	: Operating System : Windows server 2016 base

Step 2 : Choose an Instance type 		: vCPU, Memory(RAM), Network perf
==> t2.micro


General Purpose : Stable/balanced performance of compute, memory and network resources.
Type : t2, t3, t4, m5

Compute Optimized : We will get more CPU performances from these instances. We will have high perf processors in these instances.
Type : c4, c5, c6  (Compute / CPU)

Memory Optimized : We will get more RAM perf. Workloads required to process large set of data via memory.
Type : r4, r5, r6, x1, z1, u1 (RAM)

GPU Optimized / Accelerated computing : We will get more graphic processings, Efficient for data pattern matching, High level gaming.
Type : p2, p3, p4, g3, g4, f1

Storage optimized : we will get more Storage/ Hard Disk performance. FOr the application required more IOPS, we use this types.
Type : d2, d3, i3

m5.large	: 2 CPU, 8 RAM
c5.xlarge	: 4 cpu, 8 ram
t4g.medium	: 2 cpu, 4 ram

Maintenance windows : Sat 03 AM IST.. : Greenzone window : CRQ (Change Request)

Step 3 : Configure additional settings
	VPC, ROles, userdata

	Instance Termination protection : Enable (Protect against accidental termination)
	Shutdown behaviour : STOP

Step 4 : Choose storage

	root volume : volume that contains Operating system : 30 gb for windows

Step 5 : Add Tags : COmbination of Key and Value pairs.

Name : 
Project : 
Platform : Windows / Linux
COst center : AAZAA

Step 6: Configure Security Group : Security group acts as Firewall at Instance level.

OS Ports/protocols : 0 - 65535

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 
Linux : SSH : 22
Webserver : http : 80
Secure web : https : 443
mysql : 3306
mssql : 1433
NFS : 2049

source : From where you want to connect to this instance.
MyIP : It picks currently connected network ip address. No one can connect to the server apart from this particular network users.
Custom : We can give any network IPs. 
Anywhere : Anyone with valid credentials can connect to the server. (username and pwd)

Step 7 : Review and launch with keypair.

Keypair : Key pair contains public key and private key. (.pem)

AWS Holds the Public Key. This will be stored in our launched ec2 instances.
Customer/WE holdes the Private key. Used to decrypt/generate the password for initial instance connect.

Public IP : Unique across the globe : Use this to connect to your instance.
Private IP : Unique with in the aws network : 

COnnect to Windows Instance :

--> Open "run" , type "mstsc" , CLick enter.. Provide instance "Public IP".
--> Choose instance "connect', choose "RDP Client", "Download remote desktop file"

MAC : https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12


start/stop : 10 days work.. 1 month.. : Stop, Start the server
Terminate : Delete the server..


Windows : No addl softwares required..  Click on start --> search "remote desktop connection"
Computername/ip : provide public IP
Username : Administrator
Pwd : get it using keypair

==> open run (Windows Key + R) --> type "mstsc"
Computername/ip : provide public IP
Username : Administrator
Pwd : get it using keypair

==> Select Instance, Click on "connect" and Select "RDP Client", click on "Download remote desktop file", open the downloaded file.


Mac : Goto appstore --> search for "microsoft remote desktop" software.
Computername/ip : provide public IP
Username : Administrator
Pwd : get it using keypair

________________________

Task : Launch windows ec2 instance and using keypair get connect to ec2 instance.

Task 2 : Change the password of "Administrator", Disconnect from the instance. 
Now try to login to ec2 instance using "keypair pwd", "Custom password"../

Task 3 : "Create a new user" with in the ec2 instance and provide him "Local administrator rights", also provide him "Remote desktop permissions".. Take a session with this user along with administrator.
