S3 : Simple Storage Service :
-
Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2

--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS.
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe.
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit.
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations.
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is a global service. Doesn't required region selection.
--> While creating we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname (standard URL)
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

To make an object public : 

1. Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level Blocking
2. Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket level Blocking
--> We should make an object public, then only Object URLs works.
** Object Ownership : ACLs enabled
3. Make object public. (Select object --> actions --> last option --> make public using acl)

S3 Free Tier ELigibility :

S3 Storage Classes : 

--> S3 Standard : Defualt storage class for all the data we upload to s3. Data will be available immedeatly.
Designed to store : Frequently accessed data. 
Availability : 99.99%,  Durability: 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Standard-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data

Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> One Zone-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data. Store only non-critical data

Data replicates across : 1 AZs

--> Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly Glacier) : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (1 min - 5 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds. 

--> Glacier Deep Archieve : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from 12 hrs. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (5 - 12 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs
..

S3 Intelligent Tier : If we have unknown access pattern, we can choose. 
Avai : 99.9 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

Glacier data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

** Only S3 standard comes under free tier eligibility.

Task :  In Your Personal Accounts:
--> Enable "Free tier alerts". Login using root user/iam user with admin permissions..
Preferences --> Billing preferences --> Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts --> Enable and enter valid email address.

Task 2 : Create an s3 bucket, Upload an object, Make object public accesable.

==============================================================================================

D: If you are typing "Delete" ==> you'll get delete Marker. 
If you are typing "perm Delete" ==> You wont get Delete marker.

Delete the "Delete Market" to get your object back.

_________

Version : AWS maintains multiple copies in s3 bucket. 
--> Defaultly versioning will be in Suspended state.

--> When versioning is enabled on bucket, If we delete an object

Versioning : HIDE
--> S3 will show most recent uploaded object only / Current version objects.
--> We will get a Delete Marker. 
--> TO get object back / undo delete, Set Version to SHOW, Delete the delete marker.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete an object, it deletes permanently.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Life Cycle Management Rule : 
--> We can apply Rule to entire bucket
--> We can limit rule to a prefix (Folder)
--> We can limit rule to objects by specifing a "Tag"


S3 Standard --> StandardIA/IT --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Delete
 
____________________

CRR / SRR : 
--> Source bucket and destination bucket must be enabled with versioning. 
--> Existing objects will not replicate to the destination bucket.
--> All future / subsequent uploads will replicate to destination bucket. 

RTC : Replication time control : Data replicates to destination bucket with in 15 Min. (99.99% of the data) : COST US

___

Data transfer from One region to another region "cost us".
Data transfer within a region won't cost us anything.

Task 1 : Create a bucket in N Virginia, Configure Versioning and test it. 

Task 2 :  Create another bucker in N Virginia region only.. configure same region replication between these buckets.

Task 3 : Create a Life CYcle management rule to transit current version objects from s3 standard to Delete after 1 Day.
Transit previous version objects to Delete after 1 Day.


**Personal Account**
Task 4 : Create a policy to allow everything in an AWS account, But user should be able to create a bucket in "ap-south-1" region only.
--> Create a bucket in "mumbai", it should work... But if he try to create bucket in any other region it should fail.

1. Create a policy allow anything but only on mumbai region. (copy policy from AdministratorAccess)
2. Create an IAM user and allocate Newly created policy
3. Login as IAM user, Navigate to S3, Try to create a bucket in mumbai, should allow.. SHould deny if you choose any other region.

Task 5 : Configure Replication Rule to replicate data from Account-1 s3 bucket to account-2 s3 bucket.

S3 Static Website Hostic : 

--> We need to make data public read, then only our website will deliver. 
--> Purchased Domain name should be same as Bucket name. 
http://learnaws.co.in.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com  ==> learnaws.co.in

http status codes :
2XX : OK/Success
3XX : Redirection

Event notifications : 

--> SNS : Simple Notification Service : 1000 EMAILs Free Tier eligibility
--> SQS : Simple Queue Service
--> Lambda 

--> Make sure you edit the SNS topic's "Access Policy to everyone".


------------

Object Lock : 

--> Versioning must be enabled.
--> After bucket creation we cannot enable this feature. if you want this feature for an existing bucket, contact aws support.
Permanently allows objects in this bucket to be locked. Additional Object Lock configuration is required in bucket details after bucket creation to protect objects in this bucket from being deleted or overwritten.

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

_____

Performance : 
3500 PUT Object per second per prefix
5500 GET Object per second per prefix

--> Increase the uniqueness for the object names.
--> Use more prefixes (folders)

-----

Monitoring S3 Bucket : 

Free Metrics:
Total number of objects
Total bucket size

We do have an option to enable paid metrics.

-----


Storage Class Analysis : Analyze storage access patterns to help you decide when to transition objects to the appropriate storage class.

_______

Transfer acceleration : Uses Edge locations for data transfer. (COST US)
S3 Transfer Acceleration is not supported for buckets with periods (.) in their names
